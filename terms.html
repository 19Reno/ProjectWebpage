        <h3 class="fw-bold">YOUR ACCOUNT AND YOUR USER INFORMATION</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Some of the Services are only available if you create an account. When
          any of the Services require you to open an account (“Your Account”) or
          to otherwise provide user or registration information, including user
          names and passwords (“Your User Information”), you must complete the
          registration process by providing UMG and/or Taylor Nation with
          complete, current, and accurate information and must update Your User
          Information to keep it complete, current, and accurate. By
          registering, you agree that you are fully responsible for all
          activities that occur under Your Account. Parties may assume that any
          communications they receive under Your Account have been made by you.
          You grant to the Parties the right to use, store, monitor, retrieve
          and transmit Your User Information in connection with the operation of
          and/or the provision of any of the Services. Our information
          collection and use policies with respect to the privacy of Your User
          Information are set forth in the Sites’ Privacy Policy, which is
          incorporated into these Terms by reference for all purposes. You agree
          that information submitted to Your Account will be transmitted to and
          shared with third parties that may be located in other countries in
          order for the Parties to provide services to you, including, but not
          limited to, transaction processing and fraud prevention.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your
          User Information. You are also solely responsible for any and all
          activities that occur under Your Account or Your User Information. You
          must notify UMG immediately, via e-mail to customercare@umgstores.com,
          of any suspected or actual unauthorized use of Your Account or Your
          User Information, and of any and all other security breaches. You
          understand and agree that UMG and/or Taylor Nation may require you to
          provide information that may be used to confirm your identity and help
          ensure the security of your account.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          UMG and/or Taylor Nation will not be liable for any loss, damages,
          liability, expenses or lawyers’ fees that you may incur as a result of
          someone else using Your Account, either with or without your knowledge
          and/or authorization, and regardless of whether you have or have not
          advised us of such unauthorized use. You will be liable for losses,
          damages, liability, expenses and lawyers’ fees incurred by UMG Taylor
          Nation, or a third party due to someone else using Your Account.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          UMG and Taylor Nation each reserve the right to limit, block, suspend,
          or terminate Your Account in whole or in part or to refuse services to
          you, without notice to you, at any time and for any or no reason.
          Without limiting the above, if you are a repeat copyright infringer,
          UMG and/or Taylor Nation will, in appropriate circumstances,
          permanently terminate Your Account and remove all of Your Content from
          the Services. If appropriate, in their sole discretion, UMG and/or
          Taylor Nation may communicate to other users that Your Account has
          been terminated, blocked, suspended, or terminated, and why this
          action has been taken. You have the right to terminate Your Account at
          any time. You may terminate Your Account by following the instructions
          on the Services. Please note that if Your Account is terminated, UMG
          and Taylor Nation do not have an obligation to delete or return to you
          any of Your Content.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you voluntarily terminate Your Account or allow Your Account to
          lapse, you may reactivate Your Account at any time through the account
          interface on the Services. Accounts terminated by us for any type of
          abuse, including without limitation, a violation of these Terms, may
          not be reactivated. Certain provisions of these Terms will still apply
          post termination.

        <br />

          UMG and Taylor Nation reserve the right to modify, suspend, refuse or

          or permanently, for any or no reason and without notice or liability
          to you, any portion of the Services.

          recent version of these Terms. Your continued use of any of the
          Services after the effective date of any revisions means that you
          accept and agree to all such revisions. If you do not agree to, or
          cannot comply with, the modified Terms, you must stop using the
          Services.

        <h3 class="fw-bold">GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          By visiting or using the Services, you agree that the laws of the
          United States of America and the laws of the State of Tennessee,
          without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws, will govern
          your use of the Services, and these Terms and all matters relating to
          your access to and/or use of the Services, including all disputes
          between you and us and/or any of the Parties and/or the Related
          Parties. You and Taylor Nation irrevocably submit to the exclusive
          jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts seated in
          Davidson County, Tennessee, and the related appellate courts, in any
          related action or proceeding. You hereby waive any and all

        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="fw-bold">ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          These Terms shall be deemed to include all other notices, policies,
          disclaimers and other terms and conditions contained in the Services,
          including, without limitation, the Sites’ Privacy Policy and all other
          Additional Terms; provided, however, that these Terms shall prevail in
          the event of a conflict with any such other documents. Any rights not
          expressly granted in these Terms are reserved to us and to the
          Parties.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us, and
          supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals,
          whether electronic, oral or written, between you and us, with respect
          to your use of the Services and all matters relating to your access
          to, and/or use of, the Services except as expressly provided herein. A
          printed version of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic
          form shall be admissible in any and all judicial or administrative
          proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent
          as other business documents and records originally generated and
          maintained in printed form.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or
          unenforceable under applicable law including, without limitation, the
          warranty disclaimers and liability limitations stated above, then the
          invalid or unenforceable provision(s) will be deemed superseded by a
          valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of
          the original provision, and the remainder of these Terms shall
          continue in full force and effect.
